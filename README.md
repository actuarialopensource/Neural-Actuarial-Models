# Neural Actuarial Models

This is a collection of actuarial models implemented in [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax).

The documentation says - **JAX is NumPy on the CPU, GPU, and TPU, with great automatic differentiation for high-performance machine learning research.**

We are not using a neural network to predict the reserve. We just use software that typically builds neural networks.
